      <h2>Introduction to Carnatic Music</h2>
      <p>Carnatic Music is a form of Indian classical music with origins in Southern India. Lyrics in Carnatic music are largely devotional; most of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. Many songs emphasize love and other social issues or rest on the concept of sublimation of human emotions for union with the divine.</p>
