      <h2>Introduction to Carnatic Music</h2>
      <p>Carnatic Music is a form of Indian classical music with origins in Southern India. Lyrics in Carnatic music are largely devotional; most of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. Many songs emphasize love and other social issues or rest on the concept of sublimation of human emotions for union with the divine.</p>

  <h3> Purandara Dasa </h3>
  <p> The advent of Purandaradasa, in the year 1484, marked a very important landmark in the development of Carnatic music. He effected such a thorough systematisation and refinement in the art, that, up to the present day, it has remained the same. He has been justly termed as “Carnatic Sangeeta Pitamaha”. He was not merely a composer but a Lakshanakara of the highest calibre. The system of South Indian Music, as we have it now, is entirely his gift to posterity. He introduced the Malavagowla scale as the basic scale for music instruction. He also framed graded exercises, forming part of the series of lessons to beginners of music. This system prevails even today in the teaching of music. The Svaravalis, Janta varisas, Suladi Sapta talas, alankaras and gitams, composed by Purandaradasa, form the basis for mastery in the art. Among the compositional types, he has to his credit numerous lakshya gitams and lakshna gitams, tana varnams, tillanas, suladis, ugabhogas, vritta namas and kirtanas. His kirtanas are popularly referred to as Dasara Padas or Devarnamas.

<h3>Trinities of Carnatic Music</h3>
<p>The birth of the Musical Trinity – Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri – at Tiruvarur between the years 1750 to 1850 A.D. ushered in an era of dynamic development in Carnatic music. The Trinity were not only contemporaries among themselves but, also contemporaries of great composers of Western Music, as Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner and Haydn. It was the ‘Golden Age’ of music throughout the world. Carnatic music reached its pinnacle of artistic excellence during this period.

<h3>What is Music Therapy</h3>
<p>Music therapy is a professional and evidence-based practice that uses music as a therapeutic tool to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. It is conducted by trained and certified music therapists who have a deep understanding of music and its therapeutic effects.</p>
<h3>Music Therapy through Carnatic Music</h3>
<p>
  a)Music therapy, through utilization of Carnatic music and the principles and elements to promote healing and well-being. It combines the therapeutic benefits of music with the specific aspects of Carnatic music, such as ragas (melodic scales), talas (rhythmic cycles), and compositions.</p>
  
  <p>b)In music therapy through Carnatic music, the music therapist works with the client to address physical, emotional, cognitive, or social needs through the use of Carnatic music. The therapist may use a variety of techniques, such as singing, playing instruments, or guided listening, tailored to the individual's needs and goals.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Carnatic Music</h3>
  <p>The therapeutic effects of Carnatic music therapy can be achieved through various ways:</p>
  <p>1. Emotional well-being: Carnatic music is known for its emotive and expressive qualities. The therapist selects specific ragas or compositions that evoke desired emotional responses, such as calming or uplifting emotions, to help the client process and express their feelings.</p>
  <p>2. Relaxation and stress reduction: The soothing melodies and rhythmic patterns of Carnatic music can induce a state of relaxation, reducing stress and anxiety. The therapist may use slow-paced ragas or meditative compositions to facilitate relaxation and promote a sense of calm.</p>
  <p>3. Cognitive stimulation: Carnatic music therapy can enhance cognitive skills such as attention, memory, and concentration. The intricate melodic patterns and rhythmic structures can engage the brain and stimulate cognitive processes.</p>
  <p>4. Communication and self-expression: Through vocal or instrumental participation, Carnatic music therapy can facilitate communication and self-expression. Clients can express themselves creatively through music, even if verbal communication is challenging.</p>
  <p>5. Physical rehabilitation: In some cases, Carnatic music therapy can be used as part of physical rehabilitation programs. The therapist may incorporate rhythmic exercises, hand movements, or breathing techniques to promote motor skills, coordination, or breath control.</p>
  <p>It's important to note that Carnatic music therapy should be conducted by trained and qualified music therapists who have a deep understanding of both music therapy principles and Carnatic music. The therapist assesses the client's needs, creates personalized interventions, and evaluates progress throughout the therapy process.</p>
  <h3>Ragas</h3>
  <p1>The ancient medical science of India, known as Ayurveda, has a branch that details how music can heal a variety of ailments of the body and mind. This process of specific application is called raga chikitsa or raga vidya. Though not used extensively in modern times, there have been a number of Indian classical musicians and scholars who have dedicated themselves to researching and practising this form of music therapy.
</p1>
<p1>Evoking specific feelings and moods within the mind, body and soul of the listener is what Indian music is about, so it is hardly a surprise that the genre lends itself particularly well to therapeutic application. Raags are classified according to the most appropriate time of day to be played and to the predominant rasa or emotion that they evoke.</p1>
<p1>The effect of a raga on the physical body is said by some to be due to the link between certain sounds and frequencies with the chakras, the seven energy centres of the body. Just as with ragas, each chakra has a specific associated colour and various attributes. For instance, the Nabhi chakra which governs the solar plexus and stomach area is said to be aided by Abhogi , Malkauns/Hindolam, and Bhimpalasai. It is said the chakra is cleansed by these ragas, aiding the physical body, for example, with digestion as well as bringing about a change of attitudes and inner transformation and helping to give up vices and compulsive habits.</p1>
<h3>Types of Music Therapy</h3>
